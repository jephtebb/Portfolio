            <p>My name is Jephte Borno. I was born and raised in small town in Haiti, Martissant,
               where I spent all my childhood and adolescents. I left Haiti for the United States in 2009.
               When I came to the U.S, I had the opportunity to further my education,
               which I do not think would have been possible in my country. 
               I graduated with double major in Mathematics and Statistics and a minor in actuarial
               science from University of florida in 2015. 
               Since then I have been teaching math at Forest Hill High School.
             </p>
             <p>
               Ever since I was a little boy, I was passionate about two things: Math and Soccer.
               I grew up watching and playing soccer with my barefeet. Not too long ago ago, I realised that my passion
               for programming has gradually incresed since the first time I was introduced to it back in 2014, 
               Where I had to take C++ as an elective for the Statistics program. To be honest, 
               I struggled a lot in that class because that was my first time ever taken a programming class. 
               I did not even know all these cool stuff existed.
               That passion drove me to register in the UCF bootcamp to learn more about programming.
